Rye.js
===

Rye.js is a javascipt library that allows to work with finite (Galois) fields. It supports:

  - Constructing prime Galois fields (like GF[2], GF[7], etc.) 
  - Polynomial algebra over Galois fields (polynomial rings)
  - Extending fields with irreducible polynomials (for example GF[2^8])
	
The main purpose of the library — to give an opportunity to interact with Galois fields in JavaScript and it's intended mainly for academic purposes because it doesn't support huge fields.
