**Rye** is a javascipt library that allows to work with finite (Galois) fields. It supports:

  - Constructing prime Galois fields (like ![](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chf=bg,s,FFFFFFFF&chco=000000&chl=%5Cmathbb{F}_2,%5Cmathbb{F}_7) etc.) 
  - Polynomial algebra over Galois fields (polynomial rings)
  - Extending fields with irreducible polynomials (for example ![](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chf=bg,s,FFFFFFFF&chco=000000&chl=%5Cmathbb{F}_{2^8}))
    
The main purpose of the library is to give an opportunity to interact with Galois fields in JavaScript and it's intended mainly for academic purposes because it doesn't support huge fields.
